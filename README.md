# Description
There are two parts for the assignment:
1. Converter Form
2. Wallet Details Popup

## Converter Form: 
A form with two inputs named NEP and BUSD respectively. If any value is entered in one of the inputs, the other inputâ€™s value gets updated with the corresponding converted amount. The functionality is almost the same as a currency converter in Google. For the sake of simplicity, assume 1 NEP is equal to 3 BUSD.

## Wallet Details Popup: 
A popup shows whether the wallet is connected or not. We use metamask as the wallet. If the wallet is connected, details of the wallet (connected chain ID and balance) is displayed in a table. Also, a button to disconnect the wallet is provided.
